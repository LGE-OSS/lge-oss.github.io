## <center>LG Open Source Program</center>
<br>
LG Open Source Program Office manages open source and reduces open source compliance risk in the company. Specifically to do this, LG OSPO builds the overall open source strategy of the company such as auditing and constituting other policies on the use and distribution of open source, training for the software developers in the company, spreading an open source culture and activating participation in open source community. We disclose how LG Electronics has established an open source policy and open source compliance process in the [guide](https://oss.lge.com/guide) page.

## <center>OpenChain Conformance</center>
<br>
The OpenChain Project builds trust in open source by making open source license compliance simpler and more consistent. OpenChain Conformance allows organizations to display their adherence to these requirements. The result is that open source license compliance becomes more predictable, understandable and efficient for participants of the software supply chain.
LG Electronics [announced an OpenChain conformance](https://www.openchainproject.org/news/2019/11/19/lg-electronics-announces-openchain-conformance) in November 2019. This is the first announcement by a Korean company. In February 2021, we also [announced conformance to OpenChain 2.1 (ISO/IEC 5230)](https://www.openchainproject.org/featured/2021/02/08/lg-openchain-iso-5230), the International Standard for open source license compliance.
