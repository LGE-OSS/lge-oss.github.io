description: lge-ros2 is a set of open-source ROS2 package repositories that can be used by ROS2-based robots. These packages may be deployed either directly or remotely. If a robot has enough computation resources, the package may be directly executed in the device. If not, it may be executed in an edge server or a cloud and deployed remotely through wireless communication. The examples of the packages include Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), mobile robot navigation, deep-learning based object detection, voice recognition, multi-robot fleet management, and etc. This project is for anyone who wants to build a cloud robotics solution using ROS2-based LGE robots.
